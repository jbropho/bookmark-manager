# Bookmark-Manager

As a user who frequents many sites
So  that I can browse conveniently
I would like to see a list of bookmarks

User          BookmarkManager    
 |   view_bookmarks   |                       
 |  ----------------->|                
 |                    |                
 |   Array(bookmarks) |                
 | <----------------- |                
 |                    |
